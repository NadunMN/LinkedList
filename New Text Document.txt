6_1.This C code creates a singly linked list by taking input from the user and then sorts the list in ascending order.
    It prints the sorted linked list and finally deletes all the nodes, freeing the allocated memory.

6_2.This C code creates a circular linked list and performs operations such as insertion and deletion at the beginning and end of the list. 
    It also prints the elements of the circular linked list and frees the allocated memory at the end.

6_3.This C code implements a circular doubly linked list and performs operations to insert and delete elements
    at the beginning and end of the list. The code then prints the elements of the list and frees the allocated memory before terminating.

6_4.This C code implements a header linked list with functions to insert elements at the end and delete elements with a specific value.
    It then prints the linked list before and after the deletion, along with the size of the list. 
    The code frees the allocates memory before terminating.

6_5.This C code implements a program to store polynomials using linked lists. 
    It defines a structure for each term in the polynomial with a coefficient and an exponent. 
    The program allows users to input two polynomials, performs addition and subtraction on them, and prints the results. 
    The addition and subtraction are achieved by combining like terms based on their exponents. Finally, 
    the program deallocates the memory used by the linked lists to avoid memory leaks.
